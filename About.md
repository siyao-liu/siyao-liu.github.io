I grew up in mainland China. After finishing a joint undergraduate program from Beijing Forestry University and Michigan State University, I moved to the United States to pursue a Master's degree in Plant Breeding and Genetics. I obtained my MS in 2015 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After working for a global leading agriculture company as a data analyst for three years, I discovered that my true passion lies in applying statistical methods and computation tools to solve biological problems. I was inspired to pursue a PhD to advance my knowledge and sharpen my skills in computation and data science field. I am most passionate about the intersection of data sciences and biology.

I am currently working on my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology under the mentorship of Prof. Charles Perou and Prof. Steve Marron at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My project is focusing on bioinformatics analysis of single cell data. Specifically, I am working on developing computation pipeline that could automatically identify cell types that correlate with clinical outcomes from high dimensional single cell RNA-seq datasets. 

I once loved painting when I was a kid, and still enjoys art of all forms. I also love to bake but never like following recipes.
