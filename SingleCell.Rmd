The goal of this project is twofold: 

1. Develop statistical methods and computation tools for analyzing single cell RNA-seq data.

2. Apply both existing and newly developed methods to single cell RNA-seq data to understand tumor heterogeneity as well as how the immune system responds to and shapes intratumor heterogeneity. The ultimate goal is to develop more effective personalized therapies for cancer patients.
