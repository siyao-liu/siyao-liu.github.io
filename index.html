I'm pursuing a PhD in <a href="http://bcb.unc.edu/"> Bioinformatics & Computational Biology</a> at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research interests include bioinformatics, statistical genetics and cancer genomics. Being advised by <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/directory/charles-m-perou-phd/"> Prof. Charles Perou</a> and <a href="http://marron.web.unc.edu/"> Prof. Steve Marron</a>, my PhD dissertation focuses on developing statistical methods and computational tools for analyzing single cell RNA-seq data.
